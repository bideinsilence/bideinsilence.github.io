      <h1>My Journey</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a lifelong learner who's always been curious about computers and
        technology. I remember learning how to touch type by loading typing
        programs and simple games from 5 and 1/4 floppy disks on my mom's Tandy
        1000 when I was growing up. At some point, we upgraded to an i486 with
        MS-DOS and Windows 3.x. On that machine, I discovered the rudimentary
        internet growing at the time by dialing in to local bulletin board
        services. I was immediately hooked after my first few times of keyboard
        menu exploring and simple web surfing. I felt then that the internet was
        the greatest invention of my lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Highschool, I got the opportunity to study some simple robotics and
        low level programming. We learned about the electrical current flowing
        through transistor gates creating the offs and ons that become the 0's
        and 1's of binary code. We learned the boolean logic that allows those
        0's and 1's to become machine code before an assembly language. My
        school's teaching concluded with an introduction to programming in BASIC
        and an overview of higher level programming fundamentals.
      </p>
      <p>
        I went to college with no real direction about what I wanted to do in
        life other than an irrational fear of a desk job and the desire to get
        out of the small town where I grew up. So, I spent my time there
        fulfilling general credit requirements and focusing on science and
        mathematics classes that I’d always enjoyed. Unfortunately, I got so sick a
        few times in school (I would probably be dead if not for modern medicine)
        that I eventually ended up in a situation wherein I was paying off school
        loans while taking on new ones and also working near full time to afford
        also paying off my medical bills while continuing with school.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my last semester, I decided that it was all too much stress and
        that I'd leave school to work full time at my current job and maybe
        return when I had a better idea of a career path or specific subject that
        I wanted to pursue. Many years of various odd jobs later, mostly
        bartending and working in kitchens, I had my first daughter. As my family
        started to grow, I decided I was ready for something new, a way to
        support my family without such long hours or late nights and with more
        consistent pay. I wanted a skill that might be able to help people with
        more than just a welcome ear, a good time out, or a nice meal. Since I'm
        just a big nerd who's always enjoyed learning, problem solving, do it
        yourself projects, and Linux, I decided to pursue programming given that
        I'd laid a foundation for this skill decades before.
      </p>
      <p>
        I chose the Web as my path to explore software development because the
        internet is amazing (I’m often in awe that most of us walk around with a
        virtual Great Library of Alexandria in our pocket), and because my
        research told me that jobs in web development would continue to be in
        high demand. I first started with learning HTML and CSS, and while I
        still find proper implementations of each language impressive and
        interesting, their declarative nature didn’t immediately make me
        excited about learning to code. So, I decided to familiarize
        myself with more fundamental programming concepts like control
        flow, logic, and programmatic thinking at first a basic level in C
        and then further in Python and Javascript. I already needed to
        learn Javascript for the Web, and I liked that Python is taught at
        many different universities, can be used for general purposes, and
        that it has a strong emphasis on readability and conventions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not long after I chose to start learning about modern software
        engineering, I was fortunate to find a job working as an operations
        specialist for a major website based out of Seattle. My job didn’t
        directly involve any programming as I worked on a team that mostly
        attempted to stop fraud being committed through the site and help users
        comply with their user agreement. However, the site was built with the
        Python Django framework, so I got lots of experience traversing around
        the Django Admin. I also taught myself basic SQL so that I could run raw
        queries against the site’s massive database to be more effective in my
        investigations on fraud and site misuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        While working there, my direct manager was very kind to arrange for me
        an opportunity to meet with a senior software developer and talk about
        his education and career and any advice he might have for someone wanting
        to learn enough about programming to work as a developer. He recommended
        that I stick with Python as it is great for learning and that I try to
        find some projects that I might be interested enough in to help stay
        motivated and create a more practical and intuitive course for learning.
        I ultimately left that job to be my children’s stay at home parent and
        use any free time I might find learning to code.
      </p>
      <p>
        I continued on my path in web development with a focus on Django and
        Vue, although I did so after probably spending too much time learning how
        to use the Vim text editor and set it and my terminal environment to my
        preferences. Working in a terminal is fun and takes me back to the 80s,
        but it also taught me a lesson that I’ve since also heard from many
        different sources, “Read the Documentation.” So, that’s where I go first,
        MDN Web Docs for the Web and to the official source material for 
        everything else. I prefer finding a tutorial, video, or course for help
        in further understanding a technology’s implementation or concepts only
        after I’ve visited it’s official documentation. And though I’ve chosen a
        particular tech stack to learn, I strive to remain language and tool
        agnostic. I intend to use the right tools for the right job and to remain
        curious about all of the many ways to approach and solve a problem. I
        look forward to continually learning as a never ending process.
