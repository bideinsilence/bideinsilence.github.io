                <dd>
                    I want to learn Nuxt because I want to get stronger in
                    Vue.js and to stay aware of the latest web development
                    techniques and approaches, and because I like the options of
                    building applications with reusable Vue components and using
                    one tool to generate static sites, server side rendered
                    sites, or a hybrid combination of the two approaches.
                </dd>
                <dt>Rails</dt>
                <dd>
                    I like that Ruby on Rails is opinionated and follows
                    conventions, is beloved by many developers, is a great
                    framework for start-ups, and is used by many major websites.
                </dd>
                <dt>Rust</dt>
                <dd>
                    I'm interested in Rust for its C-like performance and safer
                    memory management, because of it's integration into the
                    Linux kernel, its ability to compile into WebAssembly, its
                    appreciation as a "most loved programming language", and its
                    support from Mozilla Research.
                </dd>
                <dt>Svelte</dt>
                <dd>
                    I respect that Svelte appears simple to write, compiles to
                    vanilla JavaScript, and ships with only the code an
                    application needs.
                </dd>
                <dt>Vite</dt>
                <dd>
                    Vite was made by the creator of Vuejs, so I'm eager to give
                    it a shot as an opinionated, faster, and leaner build tool.
                </dd>
                <dt>Web Components</dt>
                <dd>
                    Web Components are exciting as reusable components that are
                    vendor and framework independent, based on official web
                    standards, and supported by all major browsers.

                        I wanted to build a modern, responsive site from a blank

                        the owners are feeling it may be time, especially as a
                        central location to get their menu out to the public.
                        This site's simple DIY structure and design fits the
                        location's aesthetic.

                        Public libraries are my favorite governmental
                        institutions and we have a great network of recently
                        updated libraries in our area. So to build a strong
                        foundation in the basics of using the Django web
                        framework, I've been cloning the Spokane Public
                        Library’s website with Django. I intend to consider this
                        project complete once I’ve reproduced most of the
                        essential features of the library's catalog site;
                        search, user in/sign out, librarian accounts, access to
                        the Django admin, etc…

            <h2 class="normal">Some project ideas that I hope to build:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A cocktail recommendation app - When working as a bartender,
                    guests often ask for your advice as to what they should have
                    to drink. You'd love to take the time to have a discussion
                    long enough to determine just the right drink for their
                    preferences, mood, and occasion. But, when it's busy and
                    you're working alone or with a small staff, there just isn't
                    enough time to take 5 or more minutes with each customer and
                    and still be available for everyone. I plan to design and
                    build a web-app someone can bring up on their phone, answer
                    a few questions, and spin sort of a roulette like randomizer
                    that kicks out a couple or few suggestions. I'd like to add
                    the option for a bartender to create an account and modify
                    the suggestions to include only drinks that an establishment
                    has the ingredients and equipment to make, and for the
                    bartender to include their personal favorites and
                    recommendations. I can imagine including user accounts for
                    users to rate drinks, possibly suggest inclusions, and
                    definitely save their favorites for their next outing. As
                    someone who prefers to have a strong ale, and to visit
                    breweries, I'd like to also incorporate or develop a second
                    application for beer. And if both or either of these ideas
                    prove popular, wine suggestions and food pairings could
                    eventually be added.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A full client side SSG with a WYSIWYG editor that can save
                    itself to GitHub/Lab and/or ftp and deploy to simple hosting
                    services
                </li>
                <li>
                    A simple, asynchronous chess game that teaches players chess
                    algebraic notation by displaying the chessboard as a grid of
                    text based coordinates and pieces that only allows turn
                    movements by a player properly describing and recording
                    their intended move - I'd like at some point to add the
                    option for players to select their font, their font color,
                    colors of their chessboard, and duration of their games. And
                    then eventually, for players who feel that they've mastered
                    algebraic notation, add the option to have a simple touch
                    based chess game with either text based coordinate spaces
                    and pieces or traditional spaces and symbolic pieces that
                    lets them play multiple asynchronous games with friends.
                <li>
                    A game based on Magic The Gathering basic lands; 2 players
                    on separate machines - As far as I know, this game is only
                    know to a small subset of players and does not currently
                    exist in any digital form.
                </li>
                <li>A friends business site rebuilt with modern tools</li>
                <li>
                    A personal blog - Today I learned, explained like I'm five
                    (TLI_ELI5); hopefully clear, short, and simple explanations
                    of new topics I'm learning; mostly programming focused
                </li>

                I have to be honest that I've never really taken to social
                media. Myspace didn't have much appeal to me when it was new and
                nothing since has really grown on me either. However, I have
                held on to a few of these accounts to stay abreast of the news,
                my hobbies, and local events, or because I needed one account or
                another for various jobs over the years. The best way to reach
                me is to
                <a href="mailto:bideinsilence@gmail.com">send me an email</a>,
                and I'll do my best to respond promptly.
